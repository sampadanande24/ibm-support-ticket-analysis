# ibm-support-ticket-analysis
 A data analysis project using Python and Google Colab to analyze IBM support ticket data.
# 📊 IBM Support Ticket Analysis

This project analyzes support ticket data to uncover trends, issue patterns, and resolution performance using Python in Google Colab.

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains support tickets with columns such as:
- Ticket ID
- Date Created
- Issue Type
- Severity
- Resolution Time (hrs)
- Assigned To

---

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Converted date fields and explored data types  
✔️ Analyzed volume of tickets over time  
✔️ Identified most common issue types  
✔️ Visualized resolution time by severity  
✔️ Compared agent performance on resolution efficiency

---

## 📈 Key Visuals
- Line chart: Tickets over time
- Bar chart: Common issue types
- Boxplot: Resolution time by severity
- Bar chart: Average resolution time by support agent

---

## 💡 Insights
- **Login Issues** are the most common
- **High severity** tickets take longer to resolve
- **Agent B** shows the fastest average resolution time
- **Ticket spikes** occur on specific days — possibly post-deployment or weekend recovery

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Automate common issues (like login failures)
- Upskill agents on frequently delayed issues
- Reinforce support staff on peak ticket days

---

## 📂 How to Run
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload your `IBM_Support_Tickets_Analysis.csv` file
3. Run the cells step by step to explore the data

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me
I'm an aspiring Data Analyst switching from an IT support role. This is one of my first end-to-end projects, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing in the data field!
